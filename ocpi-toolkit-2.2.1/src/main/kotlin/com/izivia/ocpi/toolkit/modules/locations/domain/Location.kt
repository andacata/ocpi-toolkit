/**
 * The Location object describes the location and its properties where a group of EVSEs that belong together are
 * installed. Typically, the Location object is the exact location of the group of EVSEs, but it can also be the entrance
 * of a parking garage which contains these EVSEs. The exact way to reach each EVSE can be further specified by its own
 * properties.
 *
 * @property countryCode (max-length=2) ISO-3166 alpha-2 country code of the CPO that 'owns' this Location.

 * @property publish Defines if a Location may be published on a website or app etc. When this is set to false, only
 * tokens identified in the field: publish_allowed_to are allowed to be shown this Location. When the same location has
 * EVSEs that may be published and may not be published, two 'Locations' should be created.
 * @property publishAllowedTo This field may only be used when the publish field is set to false. Only owners of
 * Tokens that match all the set fields of one PublishToken in the list are allowed to be shown this location.
 * @property name (max-length=255) Display name of the location.

 * @property parkingType The general type of parking at the charge point location.
 * @property evses List of EVSEs that belong to this Location.
 * @property directions Human-readable directions on how to reach the location.
 * @property operator Information of the operator. When not specified, the information retrieved from the api_info
 * endpoint should be used instead.
 * @property suboperator Information of the suboperator if available.

 * @property openingTimes The times when the EVSEs at the location can be accessed for charging.
 * @property chargingWhenClosed Indicates if the EVSEs are still charging outside the opening hours of the location.
 * E.g. when the parking garage closes its barriers overnight, is it allowed to charge till the next morning?
 * Default: true
